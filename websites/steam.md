# Short Description

That's the short description on the top right

**DON'T MAKE IT LONGER THAN THE ENGLISH OR GERMAN TEXTS.**

If it's too long, the text is going to be cut by Steam.
If you can't make it short enough, talk to us.

### English
InfraSpace is a sci-fi city builder - but every resource you produce has to go through your transport infrastructure. In order to thrive in this solar system, you'll not only have to start mining operations and manage production chains, but also make sure your road network is up to the task.

# Long Description - Production Section
***************************************

### English
Produce Everything you Consume

Out on the edges of human space, you can't build a city by spending credits. Instead, you'll have to put your first astronauts to mining work and get some raw materials.

Once you have some iron, carbon, sand, and sulfur, it's time to set up your first steel mill and concrete factory to start laying down some infrastructure. Even necessities like food and oxygen require a steady production chain that must not be broken!





# Long Description - Transport Section
**************************************

### English
Transport Infrastructure

InfraSpace simulates every. single. car. Each resource you ever produce needs to be transported to a factory for processing and each product needs to go to a habitat for consumption.

Your road network can handle a lot, but without your oversight it will grind to a halt and drown in traffic eventually. Build highways, roundabouts, and multi lane roads to ensure the production heart of the city keeps beating.






# Long Description - Population Section
***************************************

### English
Population Growth

Your first colonists will be astronauts, the best and the bravest humanity has to offer. Give them food and shelter and they'll keep your outpost running no matter what.

As your settlement grows, you need to cover the increasing workload by employing scientists and engineers, which require a few more creature comforts. Any city of sufficient size will sooner or later be home to more and more families as well, so make sure your schools can handle it and you are able to deliver the latest VR-edutainment products as well.







# Long Description - End Goal Section
*************************************

### English
The End Goal

Humanity has discovered the technology to make artificial wormholes in order to jump vast distances through space. Unfortunately, these wormholes require portals of enormous size - no small team of astronauts can build one on their own.

As humanity's conquest of space continues, it's your job to build an outpost in a far off world capable to handle the huge amounts of resources and work necessary to build one of these portals.

You can choose to ignore the end goal and just build freely in infinite mode if that's more your style of city building!





# Long Description - Difficulty Section
***************************************

### English
You don't have to play hard

Traffic management can be fickle and survival can be tough. You can adjust the difficulties of both to make your city management experience as easy - or as hard - as you want it to be.
